# atm_manager
atm project
This  is a atm based web development project. Where a user can find nearest atm location with present cash status. Also there is admin  page where bank admin show the status of the atm. And we are thinking about a machine learning algorithm where they can easily manage in which time ,at a particular location what is the demand of the currency. But it is not implemented here.project This is just a demo project and i have not enough data to show user result. The website is developed by me and I use html,css,js, php,sql,scss.
Just download the zip file and extract. Create a database called multi_login and import the multi_login file. Create another db called dfuze. and import the dfuze file(You need to download this 2 file before the zip file) and run in browse as localhost/DFUZE/homepage.php. 
Anyone want to help me always welcome.

Thank you,
Kousik Sen
